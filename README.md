# Python-Data-Validation-Machine-Learning

Data Validation in Python for data.

•	This code was run on AWS with 16GB of RAM and high performance GPU


## Approach

• We make use of Pandas, Numpy and sys to perform numerical computations and validate CSV files.

• Initially the CSV file names are read as an argument in Python and we perform several checks to validate the file and count the number of nulls in each column. 

• We also check to see the total number of columns, and a few more parameters that can be tweaked based on your requirements.
